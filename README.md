# madlibs_generator

<h1> A Mad Libs generator is a tool or program that facilitates creating stories with user-inserted words. It typically works in the following way: </h1>

**Story Template**: The generator has a pre-written story with blanks strategically placed throughout the text. These blanks are usually indicated by brackets like <adjective> or <noun>.

**User Input**: The user interacts with the generator by providing words to fill in the blanks. The generator might prompt for specific types of words (e.g., adjective, verb, noun) or allow for more open-ended choices.

**Story Generation**: Once the user fills in all the blanks, the generator replaces them with the provided words, resulting in a wacky and often nonsensical story due to the unexpected combinations.
